# Random Walk with restart

## Theory
Originally designed for image segmentation, Random Walk with Restart (RWR) is an algorithm that gives the closeness between two nodes in a graph. Random walk is the iterative transitions of a walker from its current node to a randomly selected adjacent node.7 In RWR, at each state there is also the possibility to restart, with probability r, from the start node rather than continue the current walk. The RWR can be defined as:

Where W is the adjacency matrix of the graph, with W[i][j] being the probability of moving from node j to node i, and pt is the vector in which the ith element is the probability of being at node i at step t. p0 is the initial probability vector, which will be generated by assigning all known nodes associated with the disease of interest an equal probability of being a start node, which sum to 1. All other nodes will be assigned a 0.

Candidate genes will be ranked according to their values in the steady-state probability vector, which is obtained by running the algorithm until the difference between two steps in the walk pt and pt+1 is less than 10-6. 1
